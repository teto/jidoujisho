# 📖 Using the application

### 🚨 Supported Formats

jidoujisho will take **video and audio formats as supported by ExoPlayer**. Subtitles may be embedded within the video being played and selected during playback. 

If you wish to use external subtitles, they may be in **.SRT format** and **must be named with the same basename as the video file** (i.e. to play external subtitles for "CLANNAD S01E01.mkv" you must name the subtitle "CLANNAD S01E01.srt". You may switch between different audio and subtitle tracks. Image-based subtitles such as PGS are not currently supported.

Web support for YouTube is **currently experimental**. YouTube subtitles are taken from TimedText XML, which is only publicly exposed to videos that have user-generated Japanese subtitles. Unfortunately, some particular videos cannot be streamed. Regardless, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ0sJQC8qkE">the app appears to be functional</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9zw0QF12Kc">and has been tested with a fair sample</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1yXDcuwzpY">of practical application use cases.</a>

### 🚀 Getting Started

A primer on the basics of the application is as follows.

* ⏯️ Play a video by selecting from your **local media library or entering a YouTube URL**
* 📋 Select text by simply holding on them, and **copy them to clipboard when prompted**
* 📔 When the **dictionary definition** for the text shows up, the text is the **current context**
* 🗑️ Closing the dictionary prompt will **clear the clipboard**
* 🌐 The current context may be used to **open browser links to third-party websites**
* ↕️ You may **swipe vertically to open the transcript**, and you can pick a time or read subtitles from there
* ↔️ **Swipe horizontally** to repeat the current subtitle audio

### 📲 Exporting to AnkiDroid

* 📤 You may also export the current context to an **AnkiDroid card, including the current frame and audio**
* 🔤 Having a word in the clipboard **will include the sentence, word, meaning and reading** in the export
* 📝 **You may edit the sentence, word, meaning and reading text fields** before sharing to AnkiDroid
* 🔗 To finalise the export, **share the exported text to AnkiDroid**
* 🃏 The **front of the card** will include the **audio, video and sentence**
* 🎴 The **back of the card** will include the **reading, word and meaning**
* 📑 You may apply **text formatting to the card with the AnkiDroid editor once shared**
* ⚛️ **Extensive customisation of the Anki export is planned**
